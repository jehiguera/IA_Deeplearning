Dataset: The fashion MNIST dataset 
IDE: Python 10

Description: The fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 images for the training set and 10,000 images for the testing set. 
Each image is a 28 x 28 size grayscale image categorized into ten different classes.
Each image has a label associated with it. There are, in total, ten labels available, and they are:

(0) T-shirt/top
(1) Trouser
(2) Pullover
(3) Dress
(4) Coat
(5) Sandal
(6) Shirt
